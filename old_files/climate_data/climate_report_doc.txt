2023_winter_sedimentation
Between the December 2023 and January 2024 transects, there was an intense sedimentation event in Burrard Inlet. 
At the transect site, we observed that large rocks that had never moved previously had moved.
Other people who work in Burrard Inlet, who we are in touch with for other projects told us that their loggers placed in various places in Burrard Inlet were buried between approximately 1 to 2 feet of sediment on January 8th, 2024 when they went to check on the loggers. During their previous visit on December 15th, 2023, loggers were not buried in Sediment. They have had loggers deployed in Burrard Inlet since April 12th, 2023 and have not observed similar high sediment cover. 
There was a windstorm in British Columbia between December 23rd to 27th 2023, so the sedimentation likely happened in-between those dates.
